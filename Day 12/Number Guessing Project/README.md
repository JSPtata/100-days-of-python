# Day 12: Number Guessing Game

This is a Python console-based game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low and limits the number of attempts based on the selected difficulty.

## How to Run

Make sure Python is installed. Then run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```
