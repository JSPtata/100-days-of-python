# Day 17 - Quiz Game 🎮

This project is from **Day 17** of Angela Yu's [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).

---

## 📌 Project Overview
On this day, I learned the basics of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python and applied it by building a **True/False Quiz Game**.

- The quiz presents a series of True/False questions.
- The user enters an answer (`True`/`False`).
- The program checks the answer and keeps track of the **score**.
- The game continues until all questions are answered.

## 🛠️ Concepts Practiced
- Classes & Objects
- Attributes and Methods
- Constructors (`__init__`)
- While loops
- Data management (separating question data from logic)

Example Gameplay
Q1: A slug's blood is green. (True/False): True
You got it right!
Your current score is: 1/1

Q2: The loudest animal is the African Elephant. (True/False): False
You got it right!
Your current score is: 2/2
