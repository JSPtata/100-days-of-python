# Day 16 - Coffee Machine OOP ☕

This project is from **Day 16** of Angela Yu's [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).

---

## 📌 Project Overview
On this day, I learned how to apply **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python by building a **Coffee Machine** program.  

- The coffee machine has limited resources (water, milk, coffee).  
- The user can choose a drink (espresso, latte, cappuccino).  
- The machine checks if resources are sufficient.  
- The user inserts coins, and the machine processes the transaction.  
- Resources update after each purchase.

## 🛠️ Concepts Practiced
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Creating and using classes  
- Methods, attributes, and constructors (`__init__`)  
- Interacting between multiple classes  
- Using procedural logic with OOP design

Here is your latte ☕ Enjoy!

📚 Learnings

✔️ How to structure a project with multiple classes
✔️ How to apply OOP for real-world modeling
✔️ How to separate concerns (menu, resources, money) into different files
